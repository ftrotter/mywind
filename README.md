Simple MyWind

This is a simplified fork of https://github.com/dalers/mywind

This is just the data schema (the version with CURRENT_TIMESTAMPS) and the data. 

It is modified specifically as a test platform for https://github.com/CareSet/DURC

This repo is going to be forked again, so that I can force the mywind structure into the DURC-compliant naming scheme that will make it a good test database.

But I thought this might be useful for other people who want to quickly study the Microsoft Access 2010 Northwind sample database.
without much additional helpers. Note that dalers version has lots of diagrams and other helpful information that 
are not included here.
